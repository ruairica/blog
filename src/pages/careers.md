Application tips

mainly  aimed for sw engineering

Notes/ideas:

If you're not gettings interviews, your CV needs work,
If you're getting interviews, but not jobs you need to improve at interviewing

CV:

If you're a new grad, in uni, put education first, then work experience second.
If you have experience in the field put experience first, then education

I've found I've been making my education section smaller each time I review my CV, most recently removed secondary school experience. it's using up space that adds no value. If you have no experience
see this resume template : https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-pragmatic-engineers-resume-template/

Experience is the most important section, I put the bullet points in descending order value/goodness. The things I want them to ask me about the most are at the top, unless you don't have a lot of experience that lines up with the job description in which case you want the bullet
points that are most relevant to the job description at the top/.

If you haven't interviewed in a long time a good idea is to get a "warm up interview" for a job you don't particularly want, just to grease the groove of interviewing

Avoid saying "we" in interview when describing things you did, if you work on a team likely there were a few people involved in what you were doing, so saying we seems natural,
but you want to say "I" did X and describe what you specifically did as the interviewer isn't interested in what the team in the project they care about what you specifically did,
if you say "we built X, by doing Y to achieve Z" it's not clear what you did at all in that project.

Apply for any job you think would half interest you, as you might find in the interview when you learn more that it is something that is really interesting to you and just the way the job description was worded didn't fully explain it to you

I think it's good to have multiple hiring processes ongoing at once, if you're in interview stages with multiple companies.
It's common for a recruiter to ask you if you're in the application process with other companies, I think it's good leverage if you're able to say yes I am, if they ask which companies I'd generally say I prefer not say (no possible benefit to you from them knowing).
It also means you're able to compare differenet companies and which you might prefer at the time that's important, ideally you can get all your options at once and you can decide your best one.
Also if you have multiple offers it's easier to negotiate a higher salary at your preferred one.

Messaging people who work at the company on LinkedIn, even if you don't know them can sometimes be a better way to apply than the normal job portal. Maybe pick an employee who went to your uni, and tell them you're thinking of applying and what's their experience
working at the company, often after a few messages they'll ask for your CV and offer to forward it on, companies often have referall schemes so employees are happy to do this usually.

For interviews:
Have a glass of water beside you, you're going to be doing a lot of talking and you'll be thankful for it.
Have a quick read of the company for the possible question what do you know about this company? You don't need to know loads, if the company has a Vision/Values page know the companies values, be prepare for questions around these such
as if the company has "Creativity" in their core values they could easily ask tell me about a time you had to think creatively to solve a problem.

You can look up on glassdoor for possible interview questions from the company.

Look the interviewers up on linkedin and see what their role/background is.
Know your CV inside out, any experience bullet point or skill you have said can easily be a topic for discussion so be prepared to talk in detail about any bullet point you have, and be prepared for follow up questions, such as what were the main challenges you faced when doing that. This is why I routinely scrub old experience bullet points
from my CV in favour of new ones, some project I had on from 3 years ago I won't be able to talk in detail and answer questions about it so I don't want it on CV (again unless it's one of only a few things you have that match the job description)

Look at the job description, you can expect questions that prove to the interviewer that you fulfil the expectations/requirements/skills in the job description.

For behavioural questions try to answer using the star method https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/careers-advice/interview-advice/the-star-method
Have some stories prepared to answer common "Tell me about a time... "  questions, eg tell me about a time you worked in a team, tell me about a time you had to give feedback, tell me about a time you received critical feedback

Be wary for negatively charged questions,
such as tell me about a time you had to work with someone that was difficult (this is essentially bait to see if you'll complain about people),
What's your biggest weakness (horrific interview question), here you generally want to say, The thing I've had to work the hardest to improve is X, and I did/am doing Y to improve this.
Why are you leaving your current company? I usually try and turn this round and say why I'm so interested in joining the company I'm in the interview for, again you want to avoid getting caught just complaining about your current employer.

Questions to refuse to answer:
Your current salary, here it's nicer if you can say I'm currently interviewing at companies in the Â£X - X+5k range and just ignore the question (no possible benefit to you from them knowing), if they pry further you can say I'd rather not disclose it but again I'm aiming for X based on market research, this ties back to the previous point about it being advantageous to be interviewing at multiple companies.

When they ask you if you have questions:
Here I really want to find out what working at the company is like to workout, I'm trying to figure out if I would like to work there after they've had the chance to assess if they'd like to hire me. Asking what the team is working on, will be working on, ask about career progression at the company can show you're career focused.

This is also a good opportunity to squeeze in any good stories/experience you have that is relevant that you might not have had the chance to say during in their questions. So you can ask a bit of a bait questions asking them if they ever deal with X (knowing that they do), and when they answer you can follow up and say yeah I actually have experience doing that myself when I did X.

After the interview, reflect on any questions you think you might have struggled with and make sure you'll have a good answer if they're ever asked again.
