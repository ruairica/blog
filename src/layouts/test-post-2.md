### What is Astro?

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a javascript framework for making multi page applications mainly aimed at making content focused sites as it focuses heavily on a fast first page load and being SEO friendly.
Astro as a static site generator is quite simple, you write content in markdown, and then you can template the markdown into web pages using ```.astro``` files.
Astro can do a lot more than a normal SSG, for example it can have client-side interactivity with React/Svelte/Vue components embedded in Astro components but I won't be exploring that here.
